              <h3>Biography</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="description-holder">
              <p>Originally from Minneapolis, I relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area where I received my B.S.C.S. degree from San Francisco State University.
              I made the Bay Area my home and worked post-degree as a software engineer and raised my son.  When my recent company began to close its doors I decided to
              update my education and weather unemployment in a lower cost of living state.  I chose Idaho, however, as a long-distance bicycling enthusiast I could
              easily be lured to the Denver Area where off-road bicycle paths are plentiful!<p>
              <p>I have a broad background in both systems administration and software engineering, finding my niche in Full Stack Engineering. I have experience 
                working in both enterprise development and business consulting environments, working with development teams from 4 to 40 engineers.  Two of my favorite
                jobs were working for a medical device (oncology radiation delivery system) company - because of the amazing advances we were making to the radiation delivery
                systems, and my most recent higher education online course delivery company - largely due to my passion for course delivery and expanding my knowledge
                of course preparation and delivery.
